Automated Zonomi DNS Updator
=========

## What?
This is an automatic DNS updator using the nice API from Zonomi

## Install
Ensure you have curl & wget installed, otherwise the install script will fail (nicely).

First run this command to initially setup on your machine

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hongkongkiwi/Zonomi-DNS-Updator/master/install.sh)`

And it's that simple. The setup script will guide you through everything you need. It will even setup automatic cron updating (if you want)

## Is this secure?
As long as you don't let people get access to your API key it should be fine :-)

## Contributing
If you want to improve my scripts please feel free to fork them and 
submit pull requests, or donate me some money for beer :-)
